# Weather-Dashboard Deployment 
The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by a JavaScript code. It also features a clean user interface and responsiveness, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. OpenWeather API is the third-party API which has been used to retrieve weather data for cities.
The data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window has been closed, thankfully to localStorage.
